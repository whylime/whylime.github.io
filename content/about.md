title: About
---

I’m a researcher studying security threats and other interesting Internet phenomena. Previously, I was a security engineer focused on threat hunting, detection, and incident response. And before that, I was a quantitative analyst on a user research team.

I’m especially interested in the intersection of data science and security, and in the past have worked on projects related to anti-abuse, fraud, and malicious web app traffic detection. I also have [strong feelings](https://www.arepiechartsgood.info/) about pie charts.

I enjoy endurance sports and, while I'm primarily a runner, I've dabbled in triathlon up to the 70.3 distance. When I'm not staring at a screen, I'm probably lacing up to head outside and log some miles. I've completed multiple half marathons, marathons, self-supported 50Ks, and a few duration-based (6/12h) races.
