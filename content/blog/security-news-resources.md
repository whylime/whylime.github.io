Below is a shortlist of resources I've consistently found useful for staying current on security trends and events. This list is in no way comprehensive, but if you'd like to be more plugged in to what's happening in the security world, these are a great place to start.

    + This isn't a security podcast, but it's a short rundown of top (somewhat US-focused) headlines. As security professionals, it's essential to understand what's going on in the world and how that may affect things in cyberspaceâ€“this is especially true if you're in research or CTI.
